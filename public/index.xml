      <description>I am a researcher in outbreak response analytics, with a background in biostatistics, population genetics, and R programming. My research focusses on developing new methodologies and tools for understanding how infectious diseases spread, and how we can control them.
I wear several hats, including:
 Associate Professor in Outbreak Analytics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Senior Lecturer in Genetic Analysis at Imperial College London WHO consultant and member of the WHO COVID-19 analytics team A member of the UK Public Health Rapid Support Team Founder and current President of the R Epidemics Consortium (RECON), an NGO for the development of free data analytics resources for health emergencies Extreme metal vocalist (currently innactive).</description>

      <description>RECON learn Most of the training material I currently develop is hosted on the RECON learn platform. This includes lectures, praticals, and code gists.
Lectures  Introduction to phylogenetics Reproducibility using R Primer on statistical analysis of outbreaks Outbreak reconstruction using outbreaker2  Practicals  Phylogenetics using R Simulated Ebola response 1 Simulated Ebola response 2  Podcasts I have started experimenting with podcast in 2018. Most podcasts are under the RECON R tips umbrella, but I also occasionally post other videos, typically population genetics / statistics.</description>

      <title>Why go open?</title>

      <description>I think the first time I ranted publicly about publishing was during Epidemics6. At the time, I was making a plea for open software practices in science, which most people seem now to agree on: transparent, free, reproducible science seems to be the way forward. Practicing my talk for this conference organised by a large publishing company, I realised these ideals were thrown away in one of the most important aspects in a researcher’s life, the publication of peer reviewed papers.</description>

      <title>Ebola outbreak: what can we say with limited data?</title>

      <description>Context Disclaimer: this blog post only represents my views, and not that of my institution or my collaborators.
On the 8th May 2018, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has notified the WHO of two confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the Bikoro health zone, Equateur province. While the WHO and the international community seems to have reacted very quickly to the situation, data in the early stages of an outbreak are always scarce.</description>
